	Design Problem: Jumpstart 

Jumpstart needs a system for managing employees. The system gives the manager administrative privilegdes 
that include viewing all employees, adding new employees and de-activating employee, viewing all employees
time tables, modifying time tables, chatting with employees through the system 
and plan shifts two weeks ahead of the current week.

The administration needs the first name, the last name, the date of birth, the e-mail, the phone number, and a start-date
to register a new employee. The system generates a username and a password for the employee which they will
be asked to change the first time they login. The system generated username and password are also sent to the 
employee's e-mail.

The shifts are in chunks of 8hours. First shift is from 7AM to 3PM, the second shift is from 3PM to 11PM 
and the third shift is from 11PM to 7AM.The time table includes the workstation for each shift. Workstations are 
whole numbers from 1 to 20. Only one employee can be at a workstation during the same shift. Vacant shifts are
red, filled shifts are green, and the admin can choose to mark a shift as pending when they have made a shift 
change and are waiting for the employee to confirm via chat.

Employees can view their respective time timebles. To modify them they need to chat with the administrator.
